## 🌐 Web version (HTML / CSS / JavaScript)

Alongside the **Python** version, this project now has a **browser-based version** — an interactive equal-tangent vertical-curve tool with live profile, high/low point, K value and PVC/PVT stationing. No install, runs on any device.

**▶ Live demo:** https://bhattaraipawan.github.io/Parabolic-Vertical-Curve/

The web app is three plain files in this repo: `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`.
To run it locally, just open `index.html` in a browser (or serve the folder with `python -m http.server` for clean relative paths).
